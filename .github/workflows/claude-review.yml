            CRITICAL SECURITY REVIEW - Tuple Triggers Directory
            
            This repository contains shell scripts that users will execute on their systems.
            Assume PRs from external users are UNTRUSTED and potentially malicious.
            
            Review this PR with extreme caution for:
            
            1. SECURITY VULNERABILITIES (highest priority):
               - Command injection risks in shell scripts
               - Path traversal attempts
               - Privilege escalation attempts
               - Malicious code execution patterns
               - Unsafe use of user input or environment variables
               - Hidden malicious payloads or obfuscated code
               - Scripts that could leak sensitive information
               - Scripts that modify system files unexpectedly
               - Use of curl/wget to download and execute remote code
            
            2. SHELL SCRIPT SAFETY:
               - Use of proper quoting to prevent word splitting
               - Avoiding eval, source, or other dangerous commands
               - Proper error handling and set -e usage
               - No hardcoded credentials or API keys
               - Scripts should be idempotent where possible
               - Check for unsafe variable expansions
            
            3. RESOURCE CONCERNS:
               - Scripts that could consume excessive CPU/memory
               - Potential for infinite loops or runaway processes
               - Network requests to unknown/suspicious domains
               - Disk space consumption issues
            
            4. MACOS SPECIFIC CONCERNS:
               - AppleScript injection vulnerabilities
               - Unsafe osascript usage
               - Accessibility/permission escalation attempts
               - Keychain access attempts
            
            If you find ANY security concerns, mark them as CRITICAL.
            Be paranoid - it's better to flag potential issues than miss real threats.
            
            Format your review with:
            - Summary: A one-sentence, concise summary of findings; always included
            - 🚨 CRITICAL: For security vulnerabilities; exclude if none are found
            - ⚠️ WARNING: For potentially unsafe patterns; exclude if none are found
            - 📝 SUGGESTION: For actionable improvements only; exclude if none are found
            
            DO NOT list things that are already done correctly as "suggestions".
            Only include suggestions that would improve the code further.
            Focus on security first. Be extremely concise.
